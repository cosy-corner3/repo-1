  <h1>🖌️ Why I Love Gouache</h1>
  <p><em>A cozy note from a brush-and-breakup recovery arc.</em></p>

  <p>I’ve always been a creative kid — the kind who lived for art class, painted the standard scenery with snow-peaked triangles and coconut trees, and proudly came home with messy fingers.</p>

  <p>One summer at my grandparents’ house, I copied a cartoon from a Tinkle comic, and it looked <em>just like the original.</em> That’s when I knew I had <em>something</em>.</p>

  <p>Then school happened. Boards, deadlines, engineering prep… and I kind of lost touch with art. Until one day — thanks to Instagram reels, heartbreak, and a pandemic — I found my way back.</p>

  <p>I was going through a rough time during Covid, and on a whim, I bought myself a set of <strong>Brustro gouache paints and brushes</strong>. Definitely a splurge for a beginner, but hey — good tools matter. I started watching Insta artists paint dreamy skies and tiny cottages, soaking up all the little tips. My first few pieces were… <em>meh</em>. But the more I painted, the more it felt like <em>me</em> again.</p>

  <h2>🎨 But Why Gouache?</h2>

  <p>Honestly, I had no idea what gouache even <em>was</em> when I started. It just kept showing up in my feed — and it looked <em>fun</em>.</p>

  <p>Turns out, it’s basically a thicker, more opaque version of watercolours. Still water-activated and beginner-friendly, but with more control and a polished, professional feel.</p>

  <p>You can go soft with gradients and dreamy sunsets or bold with vibrant blocks and layered illustrations. It’s forgiving… until it isn’t.</p>

  <p>Mistakes are hard to undo once it dries. The paint dries quickly on your palette too — so yes, a little spray bottle is now a permanent part of my setup.</p>

  <p>But honestly? I love the hassle. The reactivating. The guesswork. The little imperfections. Because that’s kind of what brought me back to art in the first place.</p>

  <h2>🧘‍♀️ A Painting Ritual</h2>

  <p>Each painting takes me an hour or two — sometimes more, especially when I’m obsessing over tiny details like plant silhouettes or ripples on water.</p>

  <p>I’m still learning how to get colours right, how they dry darker or lighter with gouache, how to capture flow and texture.</p>

  <p>But every time I sit down, plug in my earphones with some lo-fi beats, squeeze out paint onto my palette, and hold that brush — I feel like I’ve exited the real world.</p>

  <p>It’s not always easy. But it’s <strong>worth it</strong>.</p>

  <p>That said, sometimes I crave something lighter. Quicker. A break from realism and detail.</p>

  <p>That’s how I found <strong>pixel art</strong>. <br>
